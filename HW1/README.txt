Manual How To Run the Scripts: 
- Create a new Folder named 'HW1', for example
- Within this folder, create 2 sub-folders named 'data' and 'images'. This is where the data (car and wine) will be pulled from and the saved images will be stored. 
	- The Car Evaluation Data will be downloaded from the 'Car' link, from the UCI repository website
		- Extract files: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation
		- Store downloads in the 'data' file
	- The Wine Quality Data will be downloaded from the 'Wine' link, from the UCI repository website
		- Extract files: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality
		- Store downloads in the 'data' file
- Upload the Python files into the 'HW1' folder from the gatech inbox
- Within the PyCharm/Python Terminal, run the code with 'python A1_Start.py' or run them individually, which will be faster for specific points
	- The 'Data_Transformation_V1.py' file is imperative to properly shape the data. 
	- 'A1_Start.py' needs all other python files in the same folder to run effectively
		- It does show a lot of comments in the terminal when running and may take a while, which is why it is recommended to run the files individually. 

Automatic How To Run the Scripts from a PyCharm Folder Format:
- Download the .zip file from the gatech with the correct file formatting
- Within the PyCharm/Python Terminal, run the code with 'python A1_Start.py' or run them individually, which will be faster for specific points
	- The 'Data_Transformation_V1.py' file is imperative to properly shape the data. 
	- 'A1_Start.py' needs all other python files in the same folder to run effectively
		- It does show a lot of comments in the terminal when running and may take a while, which is why it is recommended to run the files individually.
