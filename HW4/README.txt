Manual: How To Run the Scripts: 
- 2 gymnasium library files were edited '__init__.py' and 'frozen_lake.py'. The updated files are in the box. In order to run the code effectively, please replace the libraries
	files with these. 

- Create a new Folder named 'HW4', for example
	- Within this folder, create a sub-folder named 'images'. This is where the images will be stored. 
- Upload the Python files into the 'HW4' folder from the gatech inbox
- Within the PyCharm/Python Terminal, HIGHLY suggest running the files individually for faster results, but they can be run together with python file 'A4_Start.py' 
	- 'A4_Start.py' needs all other python files in the same folder to run effectively
		- It does show a lot of comments in the terminal when running and may take a while, which is why it is recommended to run the files individually. 


Automatic: How To Run the Scripts from a PyCharm Folder Format:
- Download the .zip file from the gatech Box with the correct file formatting
- Within the PyCharm/Python Terminal, HIGHLY suggest running the files individually for faster results, but they can be run together with python file 'A4_Start.py'
	- 'A4_Start.py' needs all other python files in the same folder to run effectively
		- It does show a lot of comments in the terminal when running and may take a while, which is why it is recommended to run the files individually. 


Necessary Software:
- PyCharm was used to run the code
- Python Version: Python 3.11.0
	- Libraries:
		- scikit-learn
		- matplotlib
		- seaborn
		- pandas
		- numpy
		- bettermdptools
		- gymnasium
		- tqdm
		- itertools
